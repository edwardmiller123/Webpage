        <h2>Personal Statement</h2><hr>
        <p1>As a driven Maths MSc student at the University of Nottingham, I am excited to further expand my 
            knowledge and skillset with a career in software development. The variety of modules and different 
            projects I have undertaken at university has allowed me to develop strong problem solving and 
            programming skills which I am eager to apply to real world problems in both technology and business. I 
            enjoy creating and aspire to work with a company where I can feel proud of the projects I have 
            contributed to.
